  {
    animal: "Wildlife Respect",
    type: "educational",
    poem: `Don't touch me, don't catch me

Please just let me be.

Observe me, enjoy me.

I'm wild, and I am free.

I'm a turtle, a lizard, a snake, a little frog.

I'm not a pet you keep at home, your cat or lazy dog.

You'll learn much more by watching everything I do.

And if you make me bite, it hurts me more than you.

Food is always hard to find

Let me hunt if you don't mind

I may have been a flick away

When you messed up my feeding day.

I'm glad that you all think I'm cool

But please don't be a herping fool.

Don't touch me, don't catch me

Observe and let me be.`

    poem: `GROUP (Collective) NAMES OF ANIMALS
Some are silly, bizarre, or descriptive. Jim Vanas 2024

An unkindness of ravens
A murder of crows
Who makes up these names?
I think nobody knows

A pod of giant whales
And packs of wild dogs
A covey of pretty quail
And droves of fattened hogs

A sleuth of brazen bears
A cauldron of flying bats
A barrel of silly monkeys
And a mischief of pesky rats

An intrusion of nasty roaches
A business of busy flies
A cloud of bright green grasshoppers
That darkens the daytime skies

A charm of tiny hummingbirds
Lots of zebras are a zeal
A stench of smelly skunks
I guess these names are real

A richness of handsome martens
A labor of curious moles
A parliament of owls
Raucous jays are called a scold

A prickle of sticky porcupines
A swarm of buzzing bees
A shiver of scary sharks
That swim in ancient seas

A group of turtles is a bale
But for tortoises a creep
A mess of green iguanas
And a flock of bighorn sheep

An eclipse of many moths
A group of rhinos is a crash
A kaleidoscope of butterflies
Disappearing in a flash

A leap of awesome leopards
A tower of tall giraffes
A conspiracy of lemurs
Crazy names that make us laugh

A herd of hefty elephants
A business of little ferrets
A scurry of slender squirrels
A pandemonium of parrots

A lounge of Gila monsters
Group name for the lizards
A skulk of Arctic foxes
From a land of ice and blizzards

A congregation of alligators
River otters are called a romp
An army full of slippery frogs
All thriving in the swamp

A gaggle of noisy geese
Lots of buzzards are called a wake
A flamboyance of pink flamingos
In a den, you'll find the snakes

That's all I have to give you
I hope you found this fun
And oh, did I not mention
A group of salmon is a run`
